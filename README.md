I needed and so made a InsideClipboard clone, the clone doesn't support viewing but it supports deleting, I use both

Delete::<br>
to Delete Rows/Formats from Clipboard

firefox will detect "deletion"/changes in your clipboard and will delete the clipboard image in Temp directory<br>
(firefox places "Copy Image" image in Temp directory)
